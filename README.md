# FreeScholars
Website

FreeScholars is a web app that allows students to view the benefits they have as students, that includes software discounts
and sotre discounts. Right now the scrapers only fetch data from the SPC and student beans as finding more discounts is 
virtualy impossible asthe stores do not offer them online, rather they put up posters in specific stores. Some manual entries
were added.

Project by Filip Slatinac and Rami Taleb, software engineering students at the university of Ottawa. 

Thanks to Vincent Diep and Abdulwahaab ahmed for their help.
